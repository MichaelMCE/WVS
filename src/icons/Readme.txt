The WVS_XP_Circular.ico & WVS_XP_Rounded_Square.ico are normal icons,
in 4, 8 & 32 bit colors, and 16x16, 32x32 & 48x48 sizes.
While these icons will work under Vista, they do not take advantage of the LARGE size Vista icon possibilities.



The WVS_Vista_Circular.ico & WVS_Vista_Rounded_Square.ico are Vista compatable icons,
that is to say, they are the SAME as the XP icons, but additionally contain a 256x256 icon for Vista,
thus the large filesize.


The WVS_Vista_Circular_2.ico & WVS_Vista_Rounded_Square_2.ico are the same as the first Vista set,
except I have removed the 4 bit versions of the icons, thusly slightly reducing the filesize.

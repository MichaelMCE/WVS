readme.txt updated.

------
0.30.6

Previouslly WVS would terminate if it detected it was out of sync with Winamp, or if Winamp delivered corrupt data.
WVS will no longer terminate but instead it will restart the network engine if the above occurs.

Winamp will now inform wvs.exe on closing. Previouslly WVS had to rely on corrupt data or timeout from Winamp.

When using WVS under heavy CPU usage the WVS aMSN message queue was being overrun causing WVS to SEQFAULT, resulting in a termination.
Queue size has been increased and is now checked for overruns.

WVS will now check and gracefully terminate a previous instance of itself.

Default config adjustments:
Playlist font is now 5x7.
Playlist encoding is now  8859-1.
Playlist now displays track number.
List removable drives set to No.


------

Added support for the aMSN 'MSN' client.
A few features:
o Complete input support allowing you to send messages to your contact list.
o IRC or standard MSN display format with contact list, and a page per user format.
o Emoticons. Could use a little help here too.
o [You've got] Mail and message icons.
o New mail alert along with sender details.
o Icons and mail alerts are overlayable on to any page.
o Locale independent (aMSN handles translation).
o Block list - A list of those you've blocked.
o Reverse list - Whose list are you on.
o Pending list - Users awaiting your confirmation.
o Accept list - All users who may contact you including those not in another list.
o Inbox
o ... and a standard 'online' contact list.

New config page design.
Added further support for MediaMonkey v2 and v3 (UTF16 via Winamp's IPC messages is unsupported).
Added a few more global keys.

Core of the plugin (host) code moved from vis_wamp.c to gen_wamp.c. This resolves the 'auto starting' issue.
Hitlist page added. Displays filenames only, functions similar to the standard playlist page.
Added the ability to configure the VU and Dancinglights effect via adjustable frequency bandwidth range settings.
Added an 'LCD Beat' (for lack of a better term) effect. Displays 'shakes' to the beat - or something like that..
Added a split screen option for the Bandwidth page.
Added a 12/24hr clock format option. Applies to bandwidth and calendar pages.
Added ability & option to autodetect UTF16 when encoding is not set to this. Applies only to Playlist, Hitlist and ID3v2 pages.
Title scroll will display complete title (as much as fits) before scrolling.
Added a 'Netstat' like statistics page. Displays your external IP, local IP:port, remote IP:port, conn type, state, process id and module path, with 3 displays modes.
RSS parser should now better handle feeds with embedded HTML.
Play button now plays the highlighted playlist track.
A media player is no longer required to initiate WVS (applet can be used without Winamp).

Ping page added. Displays a scrolling Quake-like netgraph of ICMP echos.
Added a visual confirmation when adding or removing tracks to and from the hitlist.
histlist files are now encoded in UTF8. File extension is now .m3u8
Process priority is now configurable. From idle, below normal, normal, above normal and high.
Khz and Bps icons no longer corrupt the seek icon.
Available playlist fonts are: 5x7, 7x6, 8x8(ComicSansMS), 8x9, 10x11(Arial), 14x16(Wen Quanyi 9pt - CJK), 18x18(CJK).
RSS scroller can now backward scroll.
Added Fastforward and Fastbackward to the RSS scroller via Shift + wheel.
Now compiled with GNU GCC 4.2.0

Communication between WVS and Winamp is now via a [UDP]TCP/IP socket. This means the G15 and WVS (the client) are no longer tied to the same machine as Winamp (the server) is running from.
This resolves the playlist buffer size and lag issue which some users experienced. Technically the G15 isn't tied to the same machine as WVS but thats a myLCD feature.
Reimplemented wheel/scroll/volume control handling using a low level keyboard hook. This should resolve most of the issues people we're having in this area.
Added a id3v2 Meta tag page. This will display meta tags found in the track and also allow the user to cycle through the playlist in tag mode.
Added a Fraps page. Note that if you intend on using this feature that Fraps must be executed before WVS.
Added the ability to overlay the Fraps FPS counter on to any page.
Playlist page recoded. Increased available fonts from 3 to 7. User can now quickly scroll through the list by holding Shift while using the wheel.
Added CP1250 and CP1251 encoding options.
Configurable LCD refresh rate from 10 to 40fps, default is 21. Updates between WVS and Winamp is tided to this value.
Internal refresh rate locked at 45 passes per secound, previously > 200. This has had a major effect on lowering WVS's CPU usage.
Spectrograph height is now configurable.
Added UTF16 support.
Fixed an issue with WVS unable to acquire a handle to the master volume control.
Fixed a few bugs with the RSS feeder.
Fixed a few config page settings not saving.
Crash when having gen_wamp.dll in the plugins directory resolved.
Selected volume is now adjustable from any page.

WVS has been configured to compile with either MinGW GCC 3.4 or MinGW GCC 4.2
MinGW can be obtained from either a complete DevC++ or Code::Blocks install or
downloaded seperately from the MinGW website.


Before compiling:
Path to the MingGW environment must be set within src/setpath.bat.
Open setpath.bat then modify "CMPPATH=" to point to your MingGW location. Two examples are provided.


wvs.exe:
To compile WVS from within Code::Block's IDE:
Open the CB project file WVS.cbp then click Rebuild.

To compile directly using MingGW GCC:
Executing wvs-exe.bat will build 'wvs.exe'.
Alternatively from a console window type "setpath" and then "make" from wvs/src/ will also build wvs.exe.


gen_wvs.dll:
Execute src/wvs/BUILD-gen_wvs-dll.bat


hook.dll: (required by wvs.exe and gen_wvs.dll)
Execute src/wvs/hook/build-hook.dll.bat


Plugin .DLL's for all players:
Execute src/wvs/BUILD-Plugins.bat


netClient.dll:
Execute src/wvs/BUILD-client.dll.bat
netclient.dll can be used by third party applications to communicate directly with the player.
View example file src/wvs/netClient/example.c for more details.


As of 0.30.15 WVS requires lglcd.dll. This file should be copied to the location of the media player executable.
Eg; For winamp which is installed in to c:\program files\winamp\, lglcd.dll should be copied to c:\program files\winamp\
